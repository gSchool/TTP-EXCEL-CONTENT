Pivot tables are a quick and easy way to break out aggregations within a categorical column containing distinct values. In this lesson, you increase the amount of information that you can retrieve in a pivot table by taking advantage of more Excel pivot table functionality.

### Learning objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*
* Add new derived columns to a pivot table
* Group and ungroup rows
* Overcome issues when linking to pivot tables from another cell
<br>

#### Code along: engineer new columns in a pivot table - 20 min
Complete these actions concurrently with the instructor:
* Engineer new columns from existing columns 
  * Load file
  * Create a pivot table with multiple columns that are value (measure) columns
  * Create new columns in the pivot table that are derived from the existing columns
<br>

#### Exercise: engineer new columns in a pivot table - 20 min
* Work individually and in groups of three
* Engineer new columns from existing columns 
  * Load exercise data file
  * Create a pivot table with multiple columns that are value (measure) columns
  * Create new columns in the pivot table that are derived from the existing columns
<br>

#### Code along: create references to pivot tables - 20 min
Complete these actions concurrently with the instructor:
* Demonstrate group and ungroup of row and column values
* Link to the pivot table from another cell using click for cell range
  * Illustrate issues from cell range returned
* Link to the pivot table with hard-coded absolute ranges, and show the results
<br>

#### Exercise: create references to pivot tables - 20 min
* Work in pairs
* Link to pivot tables with two methods
<br>  

### Exercise: create pivot table analysis from database data - 55 min
* Work individually and then in pairs
* Create pivot tables from database data
  * Create and submit queries to get data from two tables
  * Import data from queries into Excel
  * Clean each raw data table
  * Create a new worksheet and use INDEX/Match to combine data from the data tables into a single table
  * Create a month column
  * Create these pivot tables to analyse the data
    * Summary of revenue by month
    * Summary of revenue by month and store
  * Sort and format the pivot tables so that they're ready to share with a stakeholder
