# Data cleaning

Once data analysts import data, the next step is to make it useable for analysis. This requires data cleaning, which involves finding and then correcting or removing inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data. Thatâ€™s the topic of this lesson. (Common issues that require data cleaning include missing data, extra spaces, special characters, and inconsistent capitalization and naming conventions.)

## Learning objectives

*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*
* Communicate why it's important to clean the data
* List 5 techniques you can use to fix numbers, dates, and text 
* Apply Excel functions to remove extraneous characters

## In-class work

### Discuss data cleaning - 5 min

* Cleaning the data is an important step because if the data has flaws it may be unusable as our analysis will be invalid or we may not be able to load the data at all
* Often the data in a database has already been cleaned enough to work with immediately. However we often are not so lucky with data from other sources 
* Obtaining and cleaning data for an anlysis can often take 50-80% of an analyst's time so make sure you allocate time for this step of analysis 

### Code along: remove extraneous characters - 15 min
1. Use the [data_cleaning_demo.xlsx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10PFvbBtuSEVSmt0RmyfuzMbAERBkVY42/view?usp=sharing) spreadsheet for this code along
2. Duplicate the Starting data tab
3. Select the column headers and data in the tab and turn those into a Excel table using Data->Filter
4. In the month column fill in the blank cells with the month value
  * ```Home > Find & Select > Go To Special```.   A Go To Special dialog box appears. Select the "Blanks" option
  * Enter a formula that copies the previous cell in the column. For example, "=B2" in cell B3
  * hit Ctrl-Enter to copy the formula to all the blank cells
* Create a new column with a formula that [TRIM](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/trim-function-410388fa-c5df-49c6-b16c-9e5630b479f9)s the values in the previous column
* Create a new column with a formula that [CLEAN](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/clean-function-26f3d7c5-475f-4a9c-90e5-4b8ba987ba41)s the values in the previous column
* Create a new column with a formula that [LOWER cases](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/lower-function-3f21df02-a80c-44b2-afaf-81358f9fdeb4) the values in the previous column
* Create a new column with a formula that uses [SUBSTITUTE](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/substitute-function-6434944e-a904-4336-a9b0-1e58df3bc332) to change the previous columns values that have blanks to "widget". 
* Change the data type of all the values in the purchases column to integer from their current data types
