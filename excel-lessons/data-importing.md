# Data importing

At work, data analysts encounter multiple formats of data text files (computer files that only contain numbers and text with no special formatting), which are used to transfer data between databases and analytics tools. Each format of text file has different advantages and disadvantages—for example, some are more human-readable, others are more compatible with the outputs of modern web design—and it’s important to know how to adapt to each. 

This lesson teaches you how to work with the most common types of data text files: comma separated values (CSV) files, JSON files, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. 

## Lesson objectives

*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*
* Describe the difference between CSV, delimited, JSON, and XML data transfer files
* Load data text files including CSV, TSV, and files with other delimiters
* Set data types on intake

## Prework
* If you don't have a version of Excel 2013 or newer on your laptop, install a recent version of Excel. This typically requires purchasing and installing Microsoft Office—at least the Excel portion.
  * Ensure that you're installing the laptop version and not the Office 356 version (cloud only)
  * The Home and Student version of Microsoft Office is sufficent

<!--
* Download and install Microsoft's [Power Query for Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379&CorrelationId=ceb0208b-85a3-444c-acfe-b09fffa6498d) add-on. You use this add-on to import additional data filetypes into Excel.
  * For the add-on to become active in Excel, you must activate a setting in Excel. You will do that in class, but if you want to activate it in Excel beforehand to play with it, you can:
    * Open Excel
    * Click File > Options > Add-Ins
    * When the dialog box opens, click on the "Manage" dropdown near the bottom of the dialog, select "COM Add-ins" and click Go
    * In the COM Add-ins dialog click "Microsoft Power Query for Excel"
    *  You should now see "Power Query" as one of the choices in the Excel menu bar

## In-class work

### Discuss three types of text file formats for storing data - 15 min**

Search and find descriptions and documentation for these three data text files.  They all are file types that store data as text.

Compare and contrast these data text files and their formats
  * CSV and other delimited files - Rows and column data text files
  * JSON
      We will work with JSON in much more depth in Tablea part 2 when we retieve data from APIs 
  * XML

### Code-along: import CSV files delimited with various delimiters - 15 min**

**Notes:**

Although many people use the names synonymously, there are differences between CSV and simpler delimited files

**Instructions:**

1. Download these files for use in this code along
    * [products.csv](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn-assets.galvanize.com/gSchool/ds-curriculum/precourse/products.csv)
    * [purchases.txt](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn-assets.galvanize.com/gSchool/ds-curriculum/precourse/purchases.txt)
2. In a file manager (Explorer on Windows, Finder on Mac), click on the products.csv file to open it in Excel
    * Note that the data imported successfully; this is because this CSV file happens to be encoded way that matches Excel's default import settings
3. In a file manager such as Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows) clicking on the purchases.txt file to import it
    * Note that the data didn't import into Excel successfully.   As analyts we can not depend on the "click the file in a file manager" way of importing data
        * Rather,  our habit for importing delimited files should be to import delimited files using Excel's Data > From Text functionality
4. View the purchases.txt file in a text editor such as Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac) or a text editor with more functionality such as Atom or Sublime
4. Import purchase.txt using Excel's Data > From Text
      * Chose settings in the From Text dialog box to import the data successfully from the file

### Exercise: import files with different delimiters - 15 min**

In this exercise you will import several delimited text data files into Excel

* Work in pairs
* Import a new file using Data > From Text
* Download these Pronto files for use with Excel:
  * [2015_trip_data.csv](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1O56RgQLiOM86uH1rUizypgfzR8h1lYKI/view?usp=sharing)

### Code-along: import data into a JSON file - 15 min**
* ["Microsoft Power Query for Excel"](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-to-a-json-file-f65207ab-d957-4bf0-bec3-a08bb53cd4c0#ID0EAACAAA=Newer_versions)
  * Note that the page contains a selection tab to select use instructions from Excel 2013 and earlier or recent versions of Excel
* Download the [heath.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lsMQQzdcIHJjE6W-NfC4VMxBAUxBE5mx/view?usp=sharing) file of disease volume by US state
 * Import the JSON file into Excel from the web
   * Click on the Excel Power Query tab and then "From Web"
   * Cut/Paste this URL in the URL box: '''https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/health/health.json'''

   * Click OK
   * When the list of records appears in the editor, click transform -> to table
   * Click to expand the columns and review the column names
   * Click on Save and Load to exit and populate the Excel worksheet with the data
 * Show that to read in a JSON file that local on your laptop you use exactly the same steps but with the path and filename as the URL
