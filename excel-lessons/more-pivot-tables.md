# Additional pivot table capabilities

This lesson explores additional pivot table capabilities that you can take advantage of, which allow you to retrieve more information from your dataset.  

## Learning objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*
* Add new derived columns to a pivot table
* Create pivot charts

## Prework

## In-class work

### Code along: engineer new columns in a pivot table (20 min)
Complete these actions concurrently with the instructor:
* Engineer new columns from existing columns 
  * Load file
  * Create a pivot table with multiple columns
  * Create new columns in the pivot table that are derived from the existing columns

### Exercise: engineer new columns in a pivot table (20 min)
* Work individually and in groups of three
* Engineer new columns from existing columns 
  * Load exercise data file
  * Create a pivot table with multiple columns that are value (measure) columns
  * Create new columns in the pivot table that are derived from the existing columns

### Code along: create pivot charts (20 min)


### Exercise: create pivot charts (20 min)
 

### Exercise: create pivot table analysis from project data (55 min)
* Work individually
* Create pivot table analysis from data extracted from database data
  * Create and submit queries to get data from two tables
  * Import data from queries into Excel
  * Clean each raw data table
  * Create a new worksheet and use INDEX/Match to combine data from the data tables into a single table
  * Extract text or dateparts into a new column
  * Create at least two pivot tables to analyze the data
  * Sort and format the pivot tables so that they're ready to share with a stakeholder
