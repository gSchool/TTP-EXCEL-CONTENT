Excel is an interactive data analytics tool that allows you to manipulate and analyze moderate-size datasets. 

While most people are comfortable with the basic functions of Excel, not everyone knows how to use its advanced capabilities. This block teaches you two high-impact techniques in Excel, which data analysts use on a regular basis: how to flexibly combine data from different worksheets into one table, and how to create and use pivot tables. 

Popular as it is, Excel does have some limitations, which is why technologies like Tableau and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/?&OCID=AID719832_SEM_bHb24t0B&lnkd=Google_PowerBI_Brand&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9MyU9rqd3gIVCdNkCh0utwIsEAAYASAAEgJk-_D_BwE) (Microsoft’s version of Tableau) exist. Here are a few reasons to use *or not use* Excel: 

**Excel pros:**
* Excel is used by most organizations
* It’s fast and easy to use when analyzing moderate-size datasets or when you only need a pivot table
* Most people, even non-analysts, feel comfortable using Excel
* Users are able to view the data in more detail

**Excel cons:** 
* Sharing Excel analysis requires manual effort
* Excel’s visualization capabilities are limited
* It’s faster to create visualizations using tools like Tableau, since they don’t require you to create a proper table for each visualization 
* Excel is not a great tool for large datasets

It’s also useful to know that there are other tool like Excel available; Google Sheets, for example. Everything that you can do in Excel you can also do in Google Sheets. This course teaches Excel because it’s the more-popular and widely used tool, but everything that you learn is transferable to Google Sheets.
