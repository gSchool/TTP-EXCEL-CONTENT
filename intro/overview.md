## Galvanize Data Analytics
# Load, clean, prepare, and analyze data with Excel

The purpose of data analytics is to find and communicate insights and information. Spreadsheets are an important tool for doing this. While tools like Tableau can provide more flexible analysis and more complete visualization and communication of findings, the spreadsheet has an important place in analysis. It allows for quick analysis that can be shared easily with users. By providing analysis and reporting using spreadsheets, an analyst can provide analytics that can then be extended by the user to look at the data in more detail. Because of this low barrier to use and the intuitive way that users can work with the analytics, spreadsheets are an important tool that all analysts take advantage of.

In this block, you focus on Excel, due to the large number of organizations that use it. You learn some advanced capabilites, such as combining data into a single worksheet using LOOKUPs and INDEX/MATCH and grouping aggregates by category values using pivot tables. While your focus is Excel, these capabilites are easily applied to Google Sheets, which some organizations use instead. With either spreadsheet product, you are able to create and share analysis that combines data from several data sources and provide pivot table analysis.
